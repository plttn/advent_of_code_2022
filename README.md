# Jack's Advent of Code

Full credit for the boilerplate here goes to <https://github.com/ericwburden/advent_of_code_2022>

  ## Usage
  
  Most of the functionality of this project shell is best accessed via `cargo` (though you can
  install the project if you really want to).
  
  - `cargo test` to run the tests. Full documentation for that command [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html)
  - `cargo bench` to run the benchmarks. Full documentation for that command [here](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/command_line_options.html)
  - `cargo run` to run the first day's solutions and print the results. `cargo run <number>` to run the <number> day's solutions and print the results.
